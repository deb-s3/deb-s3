Description: Easily create and manage an APT repository on S3
 deb-s3 is a simple utility to make creating and managing APT repositories on
 S3.
 .
 Most existing guides on using S3 to host an APT repository have you using
 something like reprepro to generate the repository file structure, and then
 s3cmd to sync the files to S3.
 .
 The annoying thing about this process is it requires you to maintain a local
 copy of the file tree for regenerating and syncing the next time. Personally,
 my process is to use one-off virtual machines with Vagrant, script out the
 build process, and then would prefer to just upload the final .deb from my
 Mac.
 .
 With deb-s3, there is no need for this. deb-s3 features:
 .
     - Downloads the existing package manifest and parses it.
 .
     - Updates it with the new package, replacing the existing entry if already
       there or adding a new one if not.
 .
     - Uploads the package itself, the Packages manifest, and the Packages.gz
       manifest. It will skip the uploading if the package is already there.
 .
     - Updates the Release file with the new hashes and file sizes.
